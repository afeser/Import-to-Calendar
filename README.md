# Import to Calendar
If you are a student, then your course schedule may be very irregular and difficult to remember. This script aims to convert excel table of your program to "csi" file so that you can make it import to any calendar app you want.

## How it works?
It converts an excel table-schedule to "csi" calendar importable format. Then you can import file into your calendar application.

The program asks for a start and an end date so that it only occupies certain time interval, intented to be a regular semester.

A simple gif explains how it roughly works.

## Additional Notes
* Unfortunately, the script is highly hard coded, the simplest change in any step would end up with a big interruption of the scrpipt. But, any help is welcome!
* I advise to use a different calendar than yours, you may ruin your whole calendar.
